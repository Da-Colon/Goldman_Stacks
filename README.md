## Decription
  A real-time stock-trading simulation, combining live market data and news with server-side processing to create a robust environment to test out real trading strategies.

                                            Webpages are generated with a server-side Express templating engine and a single page load involves multiple API calls, database queries, and calculations to bring all the data together.
                                            
                                            Featured Technologies: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and AWS
